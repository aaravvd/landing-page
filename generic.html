								<h3>Intern Experience</h3>
								<p>I've interned at a startup, called WellPlanned Inc, which creats AI-generated travel plans for users. In this data science internship, I created a machine learnimg model using a random forest regressor to predict the cost of user's travels. I deployed this model as a FastAPI, and had the website connect to one of the endpoints.</p>

								<p>As a researcher, I've researched in a research group with the mentorship of PhD student in applied mathematics Christopher Degrendele(UCSC), on the topic of aerodynamic shape optimization, as well as solving partial differential equations using Physics Informed Neural Networks, in comparison to typical Computational Fluid Dynamics. I've trained a Phyics-Informed Neural Network to predict PDE solutions with up to 98% accuracy, and the PINN was over 3 times faster than traditional CFD methods.</p>

								<h4>Management Experience</h4>
								<p>As a co-founder at the Fremont School of Coding, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to enabling underprivaleged youth with programming skills and resources, as well as inspiring them to go into the field of CS, I've managed this nonprofit from scratch. I mentored over 150 students and held an international summer camp for students in India to motivate them to start programming and join a community of like-minded individuals. We are fully volunteer-based, and focus on high school volunteers. We are looking to expand our program wherever possible, so reach out to fremontschoolofcoding@gmail.com if you would like to help us start a program at your location!</p>
